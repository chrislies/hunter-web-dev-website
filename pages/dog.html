        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">Dogs are believed to be one of the first animals to be domesticated by humans, with the process of taming beginning over 15,000 years ago. Dogs were initially bred for tasks such as hunting, herding, and guarding, with various breeds being developed to excel in these roles. Over time, dogs have evolved to become loyal and affectionate companions, with the bond between a dog and their owner becoming a central aspect of their relationship.</p>
