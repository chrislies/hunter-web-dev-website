        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">Cats are believed to have been domesticated over 10,000 years ago, descending from the African wildcat. They were initially kept as pets in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, where they were revered and even worshiped. Over time, cats have become popular pets across the world, known for their independence, grooming habits, and calming presence.</p>
